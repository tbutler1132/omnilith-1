# 029 — Song Release Contributor Baseline Credit Covenant

## Context

Song organisms may begin as lightweight collaboration and later become release candidates for DSP delivery. Early contributors need a clear trust floor so participation does not feel extractive or ambiguous at release time.

At the same time, external distribution requires specific release metadata that is more granular than a flat contributor list.

## Decision

Adopt a baseline covenant for Song organisms:

- Any user listed as a contributor on a Song organism receives base credit on release.
- Role-specific credits are explicit and proposal-governed before delivery (for example: primary artist, featured artist, songwriter, producer, performer, mixer).
- Split percentages are explicit and proposal-governed before delivery.
- A Song organism is not release-ready until a release credit state is integrated.

## Rationale

- Establishes a clear trust floor for collaboration without requiring heavy upfront legal process.
- Preserves governance integrity by routing release-critical attribution and split changes through proposals and integration.
- Keeps the model compositional and legible: contributor inclusion guarantees recognition; release metadata remains typed, explicit, and reviewable.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Reduces contributor anxiety around credit visibility.
- Keeps release workflows consistent with proposal/integration norms.
- Prevents silent last-minute changes to credits or splits before DSP delivery.

### Tradeoff

- Adds a release readiness checkpoint that must be completed before external distribution.
- Requires structured role and split definitions when a song moves from collaboration to release.

## Status

Accepted.
