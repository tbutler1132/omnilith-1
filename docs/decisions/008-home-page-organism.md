# 008 — Home Page Organisms: Public Presence vs Private Workspace

## Context

The platform creates a personal organism for every user at signup (decision 021). But the personal organism is fundamentally private and regulatory — a workspace where ideas incubate, works in progress are tended, and contributions originate. It's not something you'd necessarily surface on a map.

This created a tension: if personal organisms aren't surfaced, how do users become visible in the world? How do they feel like they've *arrived*? Surfacing is a deliberate curatorial act (decision 005), so auto-placing users on the map is out. But being invisible after signup feels like being a ghost.

## Decision

Every user receives two organisms at signup, both from templates:

1. **Personal organism** — private. A spatial-map that serves as the user's workspace. Regulatory in nature: where you organize, ideate, hold works in progress. Lives in the visor (Mine section). Not surfaced by default.

2. **Home page organism** — public. The user's visible creative expression on the platform. This is their face in the world — a self-portrait, a bio, a curated arrangement of their work, or just a minimal placeholder. The user decides what it is and how much they invest in it.

**Surfacing the home page is the ritual of arrival.** During onboarding, the user is guided to surface their home page organism onto the commons (an open-trunk map on the world map designed for this). They choose their spot and place themselves. This act — deliberate, spatial, curatorial — is how you join the world. It's not filling out a profile form. It's placing yourself in the ecology.

The home page organism is a full organism: it has state history (your public presence evolves), vitality (active home pages feel alive, neglected ones go quiet), and composition (you can compose work inside it). Someone looking at your home page's state history can see how you've grown on the platform.

## Rationale

- **Personal organism stays focused.** It's a workspace, not a public presence. Trying to make it serve both purposes muddies its role.
- **Surfacing remains deliberate.** No one is auto-placed anywhere. The home page surfaces through a guided but intentional act.
- **Arrival has meaning.** Placing yourself in the world is a tiny threshold moment — more meaningful than filling out a signup form, but still lightweight.
- **Expression is separate from regulation.** The personal organism is about how you work. The home page is about how you present yourself. Clean separation.
- **It's just an organism.** No special infrastructure. The home page is an organism like any other, with all the affordances organisms have. The only thing that makes it special is that it's created at signup and onboarding encourages surfacing it.
