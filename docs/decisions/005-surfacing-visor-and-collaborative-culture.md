# 005 — Surfacing, the Visor, and Collaborative Culture

## Context

The space/device model needed concrete UX decisions: what does the space look like, how does the device manifest, and what is the relationship between creating an organism and it appearing in the world?

Separately, the founder clarified that communities should feel collaborative by default — not galleries of individual work, but collectives that produce and tend organisms together.

## Decisions

### Surfacing as curatorial act

Creating an organism (threshold) does not place it in the space. Organisms live in the device from birth. Surfacing — deliberately placing an organism on a spatial-map organism with coordinates — is the act that makes it visible in the world. This is the equivalent of publishing. If the map has governance, surfacing may require a proposal.

The space shows only surfaced organisms. Everything else lives in the device. The world is curated because everything in it was intentionally placed.

### The space as 2D zoomable canvas

Not a 3D virtual world. A rich 2D canvas navigated by pan and zoom. Zoom level maps to composition depth — world shows communities, zoom into a community shows its organisms, zoom into an album shows its tracks. Each level is its own spatial-map organism. Travel is smooth animated transitions. Physical limits and finite space create the feeling of a shared habitat.

### The visor

The device manifests as a visor with two states:
- **Ambient HUD** — always present at screen edges. Containment breadcrumb, subtle tending indicators, focused organism identity.
- **Full device** — fades in over the dimmed/blurred space when invoked. All capabilities available. Dismiss to return to the space.

### Collaborative culture

Communities own their organisms collectively. Members contribute through proposals, not by surfacing personal work. A community is a collective that produces and tends together, not a gallery of individual portfolios.

This is cultural, not structural. The kernel does not enforce it. The founder's compositions, templates, and platform presentation set the tone.

## Rationale

- **Surfacing preserves curation.** The Foundation already says "surfacing means editing the map artifact — curated, not automatic." This makes the space intentional.
- **2D avoids gimmickry.** Honest about being an interface. The sense of place comes from spatial arrangement and transition, not from simulating a world.
- **The visor maintains absorption.** Ambient HUD doesn't interrupt. Full device is a deliberate shift. The Foundation's principle — "the system tracks time so the inhabitant can lose it" — is served.
- **Collaborative culture through composition.** The platform nudges toward collaboration through the founder's examples and templates, not through kernel constraints. Communities can configure however they want.
