# Capital Community Founding Kit

Status: Working draft
Updated: February 22, 2026
Audience: Founder, stewards, integrators
Canonicality: Draft planning artifact (defers to `docs/FOUNDATION.md`, `docs/ORGANISM-MODEL.md`, `docs/DECISION-LOG.md`)

## Purpose

This document defines a practical Day-0 shape for launching a community that is both:

1. A local creative community.
2. The initial light federal layer for platform-wide stewardship.

The goal is to let the founder move from operator mode into steward mode while preserving safety, coherence, and commercial viability.

## Founder Steward Charter (One Page)

### Identity

The founder is the first steward of a living ecology of organisms. The founder tends boundaries, direction, and coherence. The founder does not need to execute every operation.

### Mission

1. Tend a coherent creative community centered on meaningful work (starting with Hero's Journey).
2. Tend the shared infrastructure so future communities can emerge independently.
3. Sustain the ecology through legitimate commercial activity that resources long-term stewardship.

### Non-negotiables

1. The organism is the single primitive.
2. Community autonomy is default.
3. Federal scope is narrow, enumerated, and reviewable.
4. High-impact mutation requires human integration.
5. Treasury behavior remains legible through transparent state and event history.

### Founder authorities

1. Constitutional stewardship authority.
2. Appointment and removal of integrators.
3. Emergency pause for platform-risk mutations.
4. Final integration authority for federal constitutional and treasury guardrail proposals.

### Founder commitments

1. Publish rationale for federal integrations.
2. Hold regular tending cadence.
3. Keep federal scope minimal through sunset review.
4. Delegate operational and domain stewardship as early as practical.
5. Preserve member dignity and procedural fairness in conflict threads.

### Delegation model

1. AI handles sensing, summarization, proposal drafting, and routine low-risk responses.
2. Human integrators hold medium and high-impact integration authority.
3. Founder handles exceptions, constitutional mutation, and emergency interventions.

## Commercial Covenant (One Page)

### Why commercial activity exists

Commercial activity exists to resource the commons and sustain the stewardship capacity required for long-lived creative work.

### Revenue domains

1. Creative output organisms (songs, stems bundles, text works, scenes).
2. Membership and participation pathways.
3. Services and partnerships aligned with mission.
4. Platform delivery for future communities.

### Resource flow policy

Every revenue inflow is routed by explicit treasury policy into:

1. Operations.
2. Steward compensation.
3. Reserve.
4. Commons reinvestment.

### Constraints

1. Revenue cannot override constitutional commitments.
2. Federal treasury actions above threshold require stricter integration policy.
3. Member-facing reporting is periodic and legible.
4. Commercial offers must align with mission and non-negotiables.

### Value exchange posture

1. Visitors can experience meaningful public organisms before membership.
2. Members receive deeper participation rights and systems visibility.
3. Paid pathways expand capacity and continuity, not exclusion for its own sake.

## Capital Boundary Model

The initial community is the capital boundary. It carries two clearly separated policy bundles:

1. `capital-local-*` policy organisms for local community life.
2. `federal-*` policy organisms for platform-wide concerns only.

If a concern is not listed in federal scope, it is local by default.

### Enumerated federal scope

1. Infrastructure continuity and safety.
2. Cross-community interoperability constraints.
3. Trust and safety minimum baseline.
4. Shared platform treasury guardrails.
5. Cross-boundary conflict pathway.

### Subsidiarity rule

Mutation integrates at the most local boundary possible. Federal mutation is valid only when local boundaries cannot resolve the concern without platform risk.

## Day-0 Organism Configuration

The list below is a concrete starting configuration for thresholding and composition.

### A. Capital root and constitutional set

1. `capital-community` (`community`) - the parent boundary.
2. `capital-constitution` (`text`) - constitutional baseline.
3. `capital-charter-thread` (`thread`) - append-only constitutional interpretation thread.
4. `capital-federal-scope` (`text`) - enumerated federal powers list.

### B. Local governance bundle (`capital-local-*`)

1. `capital-local-integration-policy` (`integration-policy`) - local integration path.
2. `capital-local-membership-policy` (`text`) - local membership pathway.
3. `capital-local-visibility-policy` (`text`) - public/member visibility behavior.
4. `capital-local-conflict-thread-template` (`text`) - structured conflict thread protocol.

### C. Federal governance bundle (`federal-*`)

1. `federal-integration-policy` (`integration-policy`) - stricter than local.
2. `federal-trust-safety-policy` (`text`) - minimum trust baseline.
3. `federal-interoperability-policy` (`text`) - cross-community compatibility constraints.
4. `federal-cross-boundary-conflict-policy` (`text`) - escalation and closure path.
5. `federal-sunset-policy` (`text`) - expiry and renewal cadence for federal policy organisms.

### D. Hero's Journey cultural program

1. `hero-journey-program` (`hero-journey-stage` or `hero-journey-scene` anchor).
2. `hero-journey-map` (`spatial-map`) - curated surfacing of arc organisms.
3. `hero-journey-thread` (`thread`) - open-trunk participant post stream.
4. `hero-journey-composition-reference` (`composition-reference`) - links to child organisms.

### E. Commercial and treasury institutions

1. `capital-treasury` (`text` initial ledger policy and state discipline).
2. `capital-budget-policy` (`text`) - allocation constraints and cadence.
3. `capital-revenue-distribution-policy` (`text`) - distribution formula and timing.
4. `capital-offer-catalog` (`text`) - active commercial offers.
5. `capital-paywall-policy` (`text`) - access thresholds for paid experiences.

### F. Cybernetic loop baseline

1. `proposal-throughput-sensor` (`sensor`).
2. `conflict-load-sensor` (`sensor`).
3. `treasury-health-sensor` (`sensor`).
4. `proposal-throughput-variable` (`variable`).
5. `conflict-load-variable` (`variable`).
6. `treasury-runway-variable` (`variable`).
7. `cadence-response-policy` (`response-policy`).
8. `conflict-response-policy` (`response-policy`).
9. `treasury-guardrail-response-policy` (`response-policy`).
10. `steward-operations-thread` (`thread`) - output lane for weekly tending responses.

## Integration thresholds and autonomy ladder

### Integration classes

1. Low-impact: AI may draft and auto-integrate if explicitly marked open-trunk and low-risk.
2. Medium-impact: AI drafts proposal, human integrator integrates or declines.
3. High-impact: human-only integration (constitutional, federal, major treasury, trust/safety).

### Never auto-integrate

1. Federal scope mutation.
2. Constitutional mutation.
3. Treasury guardrail mutation.
4. Membership pathway mutation.

## Initial role assignment

1. Founder: initial integrator for `federal-*` and constitutional organisms.
2. Local integrator set: one to three trusted stewards for `capital-local-*` organisms.
3. AI steward lane: proposal drafting, summarization, sensing reports, and weekly response recommendations.

## Weekly tending cadence

1. Review sensor and variable organisms.
2. Read open proposals by impact class.
3. Integrate or decline with rationale.
4. Append treasury and vitality summary state.
5. Append public steward note in `hero-journey-thread`.

## 30-day stabilization targets

1. Hero's Journey public experience is coherent and proposal-ready.
2. Local and federal bundles are separated in composition and authority.
3. Treasury policy is active with recurring reporting.
4. Cybernetic loop emits stable weekly recommendations.
5. Founder spends majority time on strategy, appointments, and coherence tending.
