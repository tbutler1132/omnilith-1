# HUD Elements Rendered Spikes

This pack contains static HTML render spikes for currently implemented HUD elements.

Each element page includes:

- Rendered static preview using real HUD class structure from `packages/web/src/styles.css`
- `View` switch: `Annotated` or `Visual only`
- `State` switch: `Default`, `Loading`, `Empty`, `Error`
- Behavior notes mapped from current React implementation
- Source links for translation updates

Also included:

- `design-spikes/current-state/elements/flows/adaptive-visor-end-to-end.html` for full journey storyboard
- `design-spikes/implementation-status.json` as the official status tracker for implementation parity

Open `design-spikes/current-state/elements/index.html` to browse all element and flow spikes.
